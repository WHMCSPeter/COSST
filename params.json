{"name":"Cosst","tagline":"COSST Development","body":"### Welcome to COSST Development.\r\nCOSST, also known as \"Completely Open Source Support Ticketing has one purpose. Provide everybody with a free to use, free to edit support ticketing script that provides features usually found only in commercial (paid) support ticketing software. Our intention is simple, provide a script promoting a completely free and open internet for all.\r\n\r\n### Why free?\r\nDon't you hate it when you go to look at scripts that large companies use and see the extortionate prices charged per user on a monthly basis, just to use the software? We do too. We believe that if you like a script, donate to the authors. There is no need to commercialise and make scripts unavailable for people who may be starting a business for example!\r\n\r\n### How do I get involved?\r\nThe lead developer is Peter Bishop who can be contact via email at peter [at] lostnerd dot uk. Please feel free to drop him an email with any questions related to developing or anything else! He loves a chat!\r\n\r\n### Who currently develops COSST?\r\nAt current, only Peter. We're hoping this list will increase soon!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
